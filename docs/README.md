Sonic 3 Blue Balls Edition is a rom hack of Sonic The Hedgehog 3 & Knuckles created by Dan Pollock And Michael Berry. The game has one minor change, the phrase "Get Blue Spheres" is replaced with the phrase "Get Blue Balls" as a humourous referencing to the fact that during very early development of sonic 3 special stages used the words Buruboru which is japanese for blue ball. This        
information was leaked by Sonic The Hedehog 3 play tester; J. Pataki in the following statement:                                                                
                                                                                   
"During testing of the cartridge games, the lead tester would burn several copies onto EPROMS, and then distribute them to the testers on his team. Each EPROM was numbered,and had to be signed in and signed out. EPROMS are more expensive than CDs, so they were very careful about knowing where they were at all times. Also, after the final version of a game was burned, and had gone        
through testing, the chips would then be reused for future games until they        
wore out.                                                                          

If games were burned onto CDs, such as the Sega Saturn or 3DO (for Electronic Arts),the CDs were generally destroyed or used as coasters, wall decoration, etc.They were as ubiquitous as those AOL disks that were everywhere. Most games had been programmed overseas by the Japanese, so when they came to us, the English translations were just horrible and the better grammarians in our group would      
work on making them sound less foolish. As gamers know, many of our corrections never made it to the final cut - programmers and producers care about gameplay,not text.                                                                          
                                                                                    
However, in one of the Sonic games, Sonic had to hit a lot of blue balls. The game screen said "Get Blue Balls" and our (mostly male) testing team sniggered all over the place, as will happen,because that was just funny. The text was later changed to "Blue Spheres" and I have no idea what made it to the final cut. I think they changed into red spheres.If I think of any more changes, I'll let you know."
